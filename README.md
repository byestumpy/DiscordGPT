# DiscordGPT
## DiscordGPT is a Discord bot that uses OpenAI's Davinci natural language model to provide chat-based interactions with users. With DiscordGPT, users can chat with an AI and receive natural language responses to their messages without the strain of censorship.

# Setup

## To use DiscordGPT, you'll need to set up a few things first:

 - Clone the repository to your local machine: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/byestumpy/DiscordGPT.git
   ```
 - Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
 - Setup a .env file with the following variables:
 ```
 DISCORD_TOKEN = "discord_bot_token"
 OPENAI_KEY = "open_ai_key"
 GUILD_ID = guild_id
 ```
  - Start the bot:
 ```
   python bot.py
 ```
# Usage

## Once the bot is up and running, you can interact with it using the following commands:

- /chat <prompt>: Chat with the AI and receive a response based on your message.
- /source: Get the GitHub repository link for the bot.
- Future Improvements

## Here are some ideas for future improvements to Velmabot:

Add more commands and features to make the bot more useful and engaging for users.
Improve the natural language processing capabilities of the AI to provide more accurate and relevant responses.
Implement a training system that allows the bot to learn from user interactions and improve over time.
Create a web interface that allows users to interact with the bot outside of Discord.
Explore different AI models and architectures to see if they provide better results than GPT-3.5.
